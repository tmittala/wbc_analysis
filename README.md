# wbc_analysis

In the pursuit of developing a robust methodology for cancer detection, our focus is on leveraging unsupervised learning techniques to analyze a comprehensive set of health indicators. The ***wbc*** dataset that will be used for this analysis consists of unlabeled health indicators, accompanied by a binary outcome variable denoting the presence (1) or absence (0) of cancer.

Our methodology encompasses a spectrum of techniques covered in our coursework, including Principal Components for dimensionality reduction, clustering methods, and outlier detection strategies. By integrating these tools, we aim to craft a nuanced and effective approach to cancer detection that aligns with the principles of unsupervised learning.
